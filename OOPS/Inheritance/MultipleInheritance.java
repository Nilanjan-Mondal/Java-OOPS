    // Multiple inheritance is something when one class extends multiple classes
    // or in other words, there is a child and it has multiple parents.

    // suppose we have a class A with a variable n, and a class B with variable n
    // noe there is a child (ch) which extends both A and B,
    // now when we write ch.n, then java will get confused which n to pick (from class A or B)
    // this is the reason multiple inheritance does not exist in java

    // But we can implement multiple inheritance through Interfaces... We will do it later
